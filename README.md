# cosi-rpg
The adventures of an old, decrepit college student named Reese.

## What?
This is a non-violent RPG written in Haskell about my pal Reese who is on the quest to get a degree. He will have to face many obstacles, like anthropomorphic homeworks, smart professors, and James. 

This is written in Haskell, and it will (probably) always be written in Haskell. However, adding content shouldn't cause monadic brain damage.
